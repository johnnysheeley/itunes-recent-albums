# iTunes Singles/Albums Splitter 

## Who is this for?
This tool is designed for easy library management. If you're like me, you have a fairly constant influx of both singles and albums that you'd like to listen to. The goal is to split singles from albums, and have playlists for both (or either), ordered in a sensible manner.

## Have a sample of usage?
I keep a playlist of 500 songs, sorted from most recently added (Recently Added) to least recently added. Using this as the source, I populate another playlist (Sorted Albums) with the albums contained within. I then have a smart playlist that grabs tracks from Recently Added that are not on Sorted Albums, and have this playlist sorted descending by date added. You should be able to achieve similar using just this application, but I am not sorting singles by date, currently.

## Current Features
 - Select source playlist from any library playlist
 - Filter playlists so only user-created may be used as target
 - Clear playlists before copying tracks (if desired)
 - Filter tracks by requiring a certain number of tracks per album

## Outstanding bugs
 - UI sucks. I'm new to this. It'll get better.
 - Output is virtually nonexistent. See above. :)

## Planned Features
 - Run in tray
 - Schedule runs
 - Filter out albums via user input
